title: "MicroFluID"
excerpt: "RFID has been widely used for activity and gesture recognition in emerging interaction paradigms given its low cost, lightweight, and pervasiveness. However, as wireless signal is highly specific to environment and users, current learning-based approaches on RFID sensing require significant efforts in data collection, feature extraction, and model training. We present MicroFluID, an RFID-based user activity and gesture recognition system, which informs the input state of an RFID tag using variable ID information, surpassing the burden of existing machine learning methods. An antenna developed on a flexible substrate is associated with multiple RFID chips. Chips are by default disconnected from the antenna, but a connection is created to a certain chip when gap in transmission line is filled with conductive liquid via microfluidic channels caused by the deformation of the system. Through a host of applications, we demonstrate that MicroFluID can eliminate barriers of learning-based approaches and enhance everyday activity and gesture sensing. <br/><img src='/images/firstFigure.png'>"
