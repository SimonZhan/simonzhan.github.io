title: "MARS"
excerpt: "MARS is sa toolchain on modeling, simulation, and verification for complex cyber-physical systems(MARS), including a simulation tool for Simulink/Stateflow, an automatic translator from Simulink to HCSP (Hybrid CSP), and a theorem prover for HHL (Hybrid Hoare Logic Prover). For simulation and proving part, we do support AADL right now, and GUI and online HCSP simulator is also online. For code generation part, we have already implemented HCSP to System C. The generation to regular C and RUST are on their way! <br/><img src='/images/figureprinciple.png'>"
