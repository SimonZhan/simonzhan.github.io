title: "LightSticker"
excerpt: "Internet-connected home appliances and devices are essential to numerous smart home and office applications. However, to be a part of the smart digital life, users often have to purchase new IoT devices to replace the existing legacy devices to gain the privilege of accessing device status needed for background applications. Non-electronic items and furniture such as bookshelf are completely left out of the ecosystem of smart environments.To address this issue, we propose LightSticker, a low-cost flexible thin-film sticker, created based on optical sensing, that can be attached to the LED icons or LCD display of the legacy devices or even the surface or moving parts of non-electronic furniture to sense and communicate their status of use. We discuss the sensing principle of the sticker, fabrication process, and explore its usage space in the smart home and office environments. Through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate the robustness of our implementation and its unique capability of democratizing smart environments.<br/><img src='/images/principle.png'>"
