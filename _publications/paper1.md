This paper is about a low-cost flexible thin-film sticker, created based on optical sensing, that can be attached to the LED icons or LCD display of the legacy devices or even the surface or moving parts of non-electronic furniture to sense and communicate their status of use. We discuss the sensing principle of the sticker, fabrication process, and explore its usage space in the smart home and office environments. Through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate the robustness of our implementation and its unique capability of democratizing smart environments.
