Hi there! This is Simon Zhan, studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in UC Berkeley. Iâ€˜m intertested in Cyber Physical Social System and safe autonomy, and neural certificate. I'm also broadly interested in Ubiquitous Computing and Human Factor. 

Currently, I'm working on [Project LOGiCS](https://logics.design/#), advised by [Prof.Sanjit Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/)

I'm also working closely with [Prof.Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/) and [Prof.Qi Zhu](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) in neural certificates generation. 

Before, I have research experience on novel sensing and new fabrication for two years, advised by Professor [Xing-Dong Yang](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xingdong/), Professor [Teng Han](http://teng-han.com/), and Professor [Feng Tian](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~fengt/).

My work in details can be seen in [project](/portfolio) section, and paper can be seen in [publications](/publications) section. 

For more about me, you can check my [CV](/files/CV_Simon_Zhan.pdf).
