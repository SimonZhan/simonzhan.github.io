Hi there! This is Simon Zhan, a senior studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I‘m intertested in Cyber Physical Social System and safe autonomy, and system verification. I'm also broadly interested in Ubiquitous Computing and Human Factor. 

Currently, I'm closely working with Professor [Qi Zhu](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) in global and local robustness analysis on learning-based systems. 

I have researched on novel sensing and new fabrication for two years and have been advised by Professor [Xing-Dong Yang](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xingdong/), Professor [Teng Han](http://teng-han.com/), and Professor [Feng Tian](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~fengt/).

I also have research experience in Formal Verification on complex cyber-physical system in Professor [Naijun Zhan](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/) supervised by Professor [Bohua Zhan](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=siArm5kAAAAJ&hl=en).

My work in details can be seen in [project](/portfolio) section, and paper can be seen in [publications](/publications) section. 

For more about me, you can check my [CV](/files/CV_Simon_Zhan.pdf).
