Hi there! This is Simon Zhan, studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in UC Berkeley. Iâ€˜m intertested in Cyber Physical Social System and safe autonomy, and system verification. I'm also broadly interested in Ubiquitous Computing and Human Factor. 

Currently, I'm closely working with Professor [Qi Zhu](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) in global and local robustness analysis on learning-based systems. 

I have researched on novel sensing and new fabrication for two years and have been advised by Professor [Xing-Dong Yang](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xingdong/), Professor [Teng Han](http://teng-han.com/), and Professor [Feng Tian](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~fengt/).

I also have research experience in Formal Verification on complex cyber-physical system in Professor [Naijun Zhan](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/) group, supervised by Professor [Bohua Zhan](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=siArm5kAAAAJ&hl=en).

My work in details can be seen in [project](/portfolio) section, and paper can be seen in [publications](/publications) section. 

For more about me, you can check my [CV](/files/CV_Simon_Zhan.pdf).
