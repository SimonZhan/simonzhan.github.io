Hi there! This is Simon Zhan, studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in UC Berkeley. I‘m intertested in Cyber Physical Social System and safe autonomy, and neural certificate. I'm also broadly interested in Ubiquitous Computing and Human Factor. 

Currently, I'm working on [Project LOGiCS](https://logics.design/#), advised by [Prof.Sanjit Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/)

I'm also working closely with [Prof.Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/) and [Prof.Qi Zhu](http://zhulab.eecs.northwestern.edu/) in neural certificates generation. 

Before, I have research experience on novel sensing and new fabrication for two years, advised by Professor [Xing-Dong Yang](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~xingdong/), Professor [Teng Han](http://teng-han.com/), and Professor [Feng Tian](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~fengt/).

I also have research experience in Formal Verification on complex cyber-physical system in Professor [Naijun Zhan](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~znj/) group, supervised by Professor [Bohua Zhan](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=siArm5kAAAAJ&hl=en).

My work in details can be seen in [project](/portfolio) section, and paper can be seen in [publications](/publications) section. 

For more about me, you can check my [CV](/files/CV_Simon_Zhan.pdf).
